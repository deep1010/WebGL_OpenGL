Installation

You need to install the development packages of the following libraries:
GLEW
GLFW3
GLM
Installing an IDE like QT Creator is highly recommended
We are gonna use CMake for building our assignment and tutorial codes
Using UNIX based system (Linux or Mac) is strongly recommended
Fedora
sudo dnf install glew-devel glfw-devel glm-devel cmake pkgconf pkgconf-pkg-config
sudo dnf install qt-creator # (Optional)
Ubuntu
sudo apt install libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libglm-dev cmake pkg-config
sudo apt install qtcreator # (Optional)
(Use apt-get if you donâ€™t have aptitude installed but I suggest installing it)
Mac
# Install homebrew
brew install glew glfw glm cmake pkg-config
# (Optional) https://stackoverflow.com/a/28649980/675101 (Not tested)
Other distros
Use the equivalent of apt search or dnf search and make sure you install the devel packages
Driver Issues
If you do face driver issues, try to update your drivers. If you continue facing issues even after installing, I suggest you update your operating system to the latest stable release. You can also try building the libraries, but it would be a waste of time IMO.
